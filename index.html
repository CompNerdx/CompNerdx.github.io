                When Sputnik was launched, America went into a bit of a panic. They realized that the USSR had readily
                advancing technology, and phone lines would be pretty bad for a communication system because they could be
                easily cut. They decided that they needed something that would distribute the information and rerout it in
                case of a breakage, so packet switching was created.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to this, there weren't many high power computers at the time, and people that needed to use them
                were far away from them. They realized that by linking computers together, people with low power terminals 
                could access high power machines from across the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the basis of which the ARPAnet was built on,
                which was one of the first computer networks, and was ultimately vital in the creation of the internet we
                know today.

                There is no single person that created the internet by themselves. There were many people that helped in the
                creation of the internet that contributed many different things. For example, one of the key inventions that 
                formed the internet was packet switching.
              </p>
              <p>
                Packet switching was first theorized by Paul Baran and Donald Davies in the early 60's, and later Leonard Kleinrock
                did further research on it. He went on to implement the first packet switching network, the ARPAnet, in the 
                late 60s. This formed the basis of the internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another important innovation was the TCP/IP protocol, developed by Robert Khan and Vinton Cerf, which set 
                standards for networks communitcating with other networks, which was huge in the development of the internet 
                and is a very important piece of the Internet today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Possibly the most well known of all the innovations and people that made the internet what it is today is 
                the World Wide Web and the HTTP protocol, invented by Tim Berners-Lee. This is a hypertext protocol that allows
                hypertext to be displayed over the internet in websites, and is probably the most widely used piece of the 
                modern internet.
