              <p>The internet has been one of the most influential innovations of our time. It has done so much for 
                the world. We have done research on the history of the internet and we are now sharing it with you.
                We picked three questions to research, and they are below. You can read about what we found by clicking
                on them.

                When Sputnik was launched, America went into a bit of a panic. They realized that the USSR had readily
                advancing technology, and phone lines would be pretty bad for a communication system because they could be
                easily cut. They decided that they needed something that would distribute the information and rerout it in
                case of a breakage, so packet switching was created.

                In addition to this, there weren't many high power computers at the time, and people that needed to use them
                were far away from them. They realized that by linking computers together, people with low power terminals 
                could access high power machines from across the country.

                This is the basis of which the ARPAnet was built on,
                which was one of the first computer networks, and was ultimately vital in the creation of the internet we
                know today.
