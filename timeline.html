                <h2>The Sputnik Scare</h2>
                <p>
                  In the early 1950s, the US was the dominant world power. The U-2 spy plane gave them the knowledge that they 
                  had the advantage in nuclear capability. However, when the USSR launched Sputnik 1, the media went into panic. 
                  The New York Times stated that the launch was a major triump for Russian Communism. This sent America into a 
                  science rush and suddenly ARPA became a thing.

                <h2>Invention of packet switching</h2> 
                <p>
                  Packet switching is a method of sending data over the digital network through packets. Each packet has a 
                  header and a payload. The data held in the header directs where the packet goes to reach the destination. 
                  In the early 1960s Paul Baran created the concept of this to be fault tolerant and efficent. This was
                  especially useful because they were looking for a communication concept that couldn't be easily severed
                  during the Cold War.

                <h2>ARPAnet is formed</h2>
                <p>
                  ARPAnet, or Advanced Research Projects Agency network was a part of the U.S Defense Department.
                  Its goal was to link computers in Pentagon-funded institutions with telephone lines. The cold war made 
                  military commanders seek out a communication system with no central core that was also resisitant against
                  enemy attacks.

                  In October 1969 the first message on ARPAnet was sent. The message content was “LO”. The message was 
                  originally intended to be “LOGIN”, but the recieving computer crashed and was only able to recieve these 2
                  letters.

                  TCP is one of the main protocols in the internet protocol suite. TCP gprovides a reliable error-checked stable 
                  flow of data. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn have been credited as creating the foundation of TCP.

                  The name is short for Electronic mail. Ray Tomlinson was credited as the creator of the email system. It was 
                  originally designed to send information across the ARPAnet. The email system has changed very slightly since 
                  it was first created.

                <p>
                  The NSFNET was established in 1985. Its purpose was to develop the backbone for the internet. 
                  The NSF limited the internet to government agencies and universities until 1989, when the first 
                  public ISP was released.

                  Tim Berners-lee created the World wide web, which is an information system where web resources are identified 
                  by URLS that can be hyperlinked. He created the first web browser in 1990.

                  After Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, more and more people started creating websites, and as 
                  a result, more and more people started using the internet. It kept getting more and more popular, and now we 
                  use it every day!
